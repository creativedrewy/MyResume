# What You Need to Know:

- I've been working with the Android platform since 2010. I've successfully developed and led multiple consumer-facing, high-rated Play Store apps.
- I'm super passionate about excellent application architecture, maintainability, and code quality. I do it for my own sanity; I have the 
  most fun when I'm working in a quality code base.
- I've been a lead developer for years. I've successfully led countless projects involving multiple and varied programming languages, frameworks, and platforms. My team size was usually 1 to 8 developers.
- I love keeping up with the latest programming technologies and frameworks, not just in Android dev. If it's cool, I'm probably interested.

# Highlights:

- My Android Wear app - WeaRSS - was featured as "Hand-Picked for Wear" in the Play Store. At the time I got some other good internet coverage too:
