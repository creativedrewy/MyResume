# The Details

### GoPro
- Implemented a media-oriented Android library for utilization within multiple GoPro Android apps. It had an intuitive interface that made extending for new use cases really simple.
- Easily adapted my video compositor system (see Vemory section) to be utilized with a yet-to-be-released GoPro technology. Win!
- Joined the development efforts of the flagship GoPro app, fixing bugs prior to a crucial release.

### Vemory
- Advanced work with Android media APIs: implemented a slick NLE-inspired, timeline-based "video compositor" system. Involved OpenGL rendering with realtime shader effects.
- Wrote a Fluent API library encapsulating the (complex and wierd) FFMpeg command line interface, enabling it to be easily utilized within an Android app.
- We were a startup that actually got acquired. Win!

### Novu
- Ported Novu's existing iOS app to Android and successfully released it to the Play store.
- Learned Swift and general iOS development by contributing some features to the iOS app.

### The Nerdery
- I was the lead developer on tons of projects - Android apps as well as other languages and platforms (more on that in a bit).
- Mentored other Android developers.
- Was part of the Android committee that guided all the Android development in the company.
- I started as a Flash developer(!). We made some really cool apps back in the day. But I never wanted to stick to just one platform.
- Other technologies I developed with: ASP MVC, Xamarin, Sitecore, Single-page Javascript apps, PHP, WordPress, AngularJS (1.x), and more.

#### As a lead developer, I would:
- Decide and advise on project technology with the internal team and clients.
- Work with UX to come up with platform-appropriate app user interfaces.
- Choose architecture for the project including relevant libraries and best practices.
- Implement initial project code in preparation for other developers to join.
- Write project documentation, decide development task breakdown.
- Delegate tasks to teams of 2 to 8 developers and ensure successful development completion.
- Complete my own development tasks and move the project forward.

### Kroll Ontrack
- I actually started as a Test Engineer, but then largely self-taught myself C# and WinForms desktop app development.
- Worked on a variety of line-of-business WinForms apps that interfaced with large-scale databases.
- Rewrote a particular tool that reduced task completion time from multiple days to mere seconds. Win!
